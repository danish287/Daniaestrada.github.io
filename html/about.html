                  <p>Hello, welcome to my site! </p>
                  <p id="intro-rest"> 
                     I am a recent graduate of Duke University, where I majored in computer science and minored in visual and media studies, interested in amplifying underrepresented voices in technology-related environments. I hope to combine my computer science knowledge with my interest in social justice and equity to engage in projects that contribute to the greater good. 
                  </p>
                  <p id="intro-rest"> My involvement with campus organizations like HackDuke have heightened my interest in using technology as a tool to create products that account for underrepresented peoples. For example, I learned that the products being created during our annual Hackathons were not as useful to the communities they were meant for because those communities had other needs that needed to be met first. Having a voice to express those needs has been a catalyst to the usefulness of the projects coded during this time. My social justice involvements along with computer science background will allow me to make wholesome contributions to my future projects that account for more than just technical aspects.</p>
                  <p id="intro-rest"> 
                     I also enjoy visual arts and have begun several projects, such as my blog, that have allowed me to use my creative talents to create influential platforms.
                  </p>
                  <p id="intro-rest"> 
                     I am currently interested in a full-time position as a software developer with companies that understand the importance of diversity and inclusion within their work environment.
